# ark - Docs Branch

This special branch (`gh-pages`) is used to generate the [public documentation site](https://heptio.github.io/ark)
for ark. This site is hosted using [Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/).

The content files in this branch were generated using the [`doc-site-gen` tool](https://github.com/heptio/doc-site-gen). This means that if you change docs content in this branch to fix something on the docs site, make sure to change the equivalent content in the docs directory on the master branch.

To learn how to add new versions to this site, update "master", enable/disable versions, or generate a new docs site, see the [README for doc-site gen](https://github.com/heptio/doc-site-gen/README.md).
